# Space-Invaders

Space Invaders replica game programmed in python

## Description

This is a dynamic Space Invaders game I programmed in python, with some advice coming from tutorials. The game requires use of img assets
provided in the repository. 

The player begins with 100 health and 5 lives.

The goal of the game is to prevent yourself from being hit by enemy lasers, and enemies crossing player lines. For each laser hit, or
each player/enemy collision, the player loses -10 health. If an enemy passes below the height of the screen, the player loses a life.
If the player loses all 5 lives, the game ends.

Keys:
W - Up
A - Left
S - Down
D - Right
SPACE - Shoot
